In this systematic analysis, we show that CCP from unvaccinated donors is not effective against Omicron, while CCP from vaccinees convalescents from previous VOCs or third-dose uninfected vaccinees is likely to remain effective against Omicron. CCP remains the only antibody-based therapy that keeps up with the variants and provides an effective tool to combat the emergence of variants that defeat monoclonal antibodies.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of MRSA isolates for surveillance is valuable for detecting outbreaks in hospitals, but the bioinformatic approaches used are diverse and difficult to compare.\\n\\nMethodsWe combined short-read WGS with genotypic, phenotypic, and epidemiological characteristics of 106 MRSA BSI isolates collected for routine microbiological diagnosis from inpatients in two hospitals over 12 months. Clinical data and hospitalization history were abstracted from electronic medical records. We compared three genome sequence alignment strategies to assess similarity in cluster ascertainment. We conducted logistic regression to measure the probability of predicting prior hospital overlap between clustered patient isolates by the genetic distance of their isolates.\\n\\nResultsWhile the three alignment approaches detected similar results, they showed some variation. A pangenome-based alignment method was most consistent across MRSA clonal complexes. We identified nine unique clusters of closely-related BSI isolates. Most BSI were healthcare-associated and community-onset. Our logistic model showed that with 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms the likelihood that any two patients in a cluster overlapped in a hospital was 50 percent.\\n\\nConclusionsMultiple clusters of closely related MRSA isolates can be identified using WGS among strains cultured from BSI in two hospitals. Genomic clustering of these infections suggest that transmission resulted from a mix of community spread and healthcare exposures long before BSI diagnosis.\\n\\nSummaryMultiple clusters of closely related MRSA bloodstream infections were identified using WGS in two hospitals using three bioinformatic workflows.

This binding is transiently disrupted during periods of post-traumatic amnesia following significant head injuries. The reason for this impairment is unclear but may be due to electrophysiological changes produced by head impacts. These are common and include pathological low frequency activity, which is associated with poorer neurological outcomes and may disrupt cortical communication. Here, we investigate associative memory binding during post-traumatic amnesia and test the hypothesis that misbinding is caused by a disruption in cortical communication produced by the pathological slowing of brain activity. Thirty acute moderate-severe traumatic brain injury patients (mean time since injury = 10 days) and 26 healthy controls were tested with a precision working memory paradigm that required the association of object and location information. A novel entropy ratio measure was calculated from behavioural performance. This provided a continuous measure of the degree of misbinding and the influence of distracting information. Resting state EEG was used to assess the electrophysiological effects of traumatic brain injury. Patients in post-traumatic amnesia showed abnormalities in working memory function and made significantly more misbinding errors than patients who were not in post-traumatic amnesia and controls. Patients showed a higher entropy ratio in the distribution of spatial responses, indicating that working memory recall was abnormally biased by the locations of non-target items suggesting a specific impairment of object and location binding. Slow wave activity was increased following traumatic brain injury. Increases in the delta-alpha ratio indicative of an increase in low frequency power specifically correlated with binding impairment in working memory. In contrast, although connectivity was increased in the theta band and decreased in the alpha band after traumatic brain injury, this did not correlate with working memory impairment. Working memory and electrophysiological abnormalities both normalised at six-month follow-up, in keeping with a transient increase in slow-wave activity causing post-traumatic amnesia that impaired working memory function. These results show that patients in post-traumatic amnesia show high rates of working memory misbinding that are associated with a pathological shift towards lower frequency oscillations.\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"},{\"doi\":\"10.1101\\/2021.12.24.21268371\",\"title\":\"Relative Importance of Various Inflammatory Markers and Their Critical Thresholds for COVID-19 Mortality\",\"authors\":\"budhiraja, s.; Indrayan, A.; das, p.; dewan, a.; singh, o.; nangia, v.; singh, y. p.; pandey, r.; gupta, a. k.; gupta, m.; bhasin, d.; uniyal, b.; mathur, m.; pawar, m.\",\"author_corresponding\":\"sandeep budhiraja\",\"author_corresponding_institution\":\"Clinical Directorate and Dept of Internal Medicine, Max Healthcare\",\"date\":\"2021-12-25\",\"version\":\"1\",\"type\":\"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT\",\"license\":\"cc_no\",\"category\":\"infectious diseases\",\"jatsxml\":\"https:\\/\\/www.medrxiv.org\\/content\\/early\\/2021\\/12\\/25\\/2021.12.24.21268371.source.xml\",\"abstract\":\"BackgroundVarious inflammatory markers are commonly assessed in many patients to help in the management of COVID-19 patients. It is not clear, though, how much risk of mortality their different levels of elevations entail, and which marker signifies more risk than others and how much. This study was undertaken to describe their levels and to answer these questions regarding eight inflammatory markers, namely, CRP, D-dimer, ferritin, IL-6, LDH, CPK, troponin-I.\\n\\nMethodsThe data were retrieved from the electronic records of 19852 CoViD-19 patients admitted to a chain of hospitals in north India from March 2020 to July 2021. Levels for most markers were available for more than 10,000 patients. In view of widely different ranges of values of different markers, we divided their values into quintiles (Qs) and studied the pattern of mortality and for running the logistic regression. In addition, logarithm transformation was also tried. The statistical distribution of the values was compared by Mann-Whitney test. Relative importance was judged by the mortality rates, area under the ROC curves (AUROCs), and the odds ratios.\\n\\nResultsAlthough the mortality increased with decreasing ALC and increasing level of all the other markers, more than 70% survived even with levels in the extreme quintile. The adjusted odds ratio was the highest (7.62) for the Q5 levels of IL-6, closely followed by D-dimer (OR = 6.04). The AUROC was the highest (0.817) for LDH and the least (0.612) for CPK. However, the optimal cut-off for any marker could correctly classify not more than 80% deaths and the multivariable logistic regression could correctly classify patients with mortality in less than 24% cases.\\n\\nConclusionAlthough elevated levels of all the markers and low values of ALC were significant risk factor but no firm evidence was available for any of the eight markers to be a major indicator of the mortality in COVID-19 unless they reach to a critical threshold. Among those studied, D-Dimer (>192 ng\\/mL) followed by IL-6 (>4.5 pg\\/mL) had stronger association with mortality even with moderate and higher end of the normal levels and LDH (>433 U\\/L) and troponin-I (>0.002ng\\/mL) with only steeply increased levels. Ferritin had modest association, and CPK, CRP and ALC were a relatively poor risk of mortality.\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"},{\"doi\":\"10.1101\\/2021.12.23.21268321\",\"title\":\"Influenza A H1N1 mediated pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 predicts COVID-19 outbreak dynamics\",\"authors\":\"Martin Almazan, N.; Rahbar, A.; Carlsson, M.; Hoffman, T.; Kolstad, L.; Ronnberg, B.; Russel Pantalone, M.; Lewensohn Fuchs, I.; Naucler, A.; Ohlin, M.; Sacharczuk, M.; Religa, P.; Amer, S.; Molnar, C.; Lundkvist, A.; Susrud, A.; Sorensen, B.; Soderberg-Naucler, C.\",\"author_corresponding\":\"Cecilia Soderberg-Naucler\",\"author_corresponding_institution\":\"Department of Medicine, Unit for Microbial Pathogenesis, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

Here we introduce a methodology to quantify the genome-wide distinctiveness of polynucleotide fragments of various lengths (3-to 240-mers) that constitute SARS-CoV-2 sequences (freely available at https:\\/\\/academia.nferx.com\\/GENI). Compared to standard phylogenetic distance metrics and overall mutational load, the quantification of distinctive 9-mer polynucleotides provides a higher resolution of separation between VOCs (Reference = 89, IQR: 65-108; Alpha = 166, IQR: 150-182; Beta 130, IQR: 113-147; Gamma = 165, IQR: 152-180; Delta = 234, IQR: 216-253; and Omicron = 294, IQR: 287-315). Omicrons exceptionally high genomic distinctiveness may confer a competitive advantage over both prior VOCs (including Delta) and the recently emerged and highly mutated B.1.640.2 (IHU) lineage. Expanding on this analysis, evaluation of genomic distinctiveness weighted by intra-lineage 9-mer conservation for 1,363 lineages annotated in GISAID highlights that genomic distinctiveness has increased over time (R2=0.37) and that VOCs score significantly higher than contemporary non-VOC lineages, with Omicron among the most distinctive lineages observed till date. This study demonstrates the value of characterizing new SARS-CoV-2 variants by their genome-wide polynucleotide distinctiveness and emphasizes the need to go beyond a narrow set of mutations at known functionally or antigenically salient sites on the Spike protein. The consistently higher distinctiveness of each emerging VOC compared to prior VOCs suggests that real-time monitoring of genomic distinctiveness would aid in more rapid assessment of viral fitness.\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"},{\"doi\":\"10.1101\\/2021.12.24.21268370\",\"title\":\"A novel methodology for the synchronous collection and multimodal visualisation of continuous neurocardiovascular and neuromuscular physiological data in adults with long COVID\",\"authors\":\"Xue, F.; Monaghan, A.; Jennings, G.; Byrne, L.; Foran, T.; Duggan, E.; Romero-Ortuno, R.\",\"author_corresponding\":\"Feng Xue\",\"author_corresponding_institution\":\"Trinity College Dublin\",\"date\":\"2021-12-25\",\"version\":\"1\",\"type\":\"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT\",\"license\":\"cc_by_nc\",\"category\":\"cardiovascular medicine\",\"jatsxml\":\"https:\\/\\/www.medrxiv.org\\/content\\/early\\/2021\\/12\\/25\\/2021.12.24.21268370.source.xml\",\"abstract\":\"Reports suggest that adults with post-COVID-19 syndrome or long COVID may be affected by orthostatic intolerance syndromes, with autonomic nervous system dysfunction as a possible causal factor of neurocardiovascular instability (NCVI). Long COVID can also manifest as prolonged fatigue, which may be linked to neuromuscular function impairment (NMFI). The current clinical assessment for NCVI monitors neurocardiovascular performance upon the application of orthostatic stressors such as an active (i.e. self-induced) stand or a passive (tilt table) standing test. Lower limb muscle contractions may be important in orthostatic recovery via the skeletal muscle pump. In this study, adults with long COVID were assessed with a protocol that, in addition to the standard NCVI tests, incorporated simultaneous lower limb muscle monitoring for NMFI assessment. To accomplish such an investigation, a wide range of continuous non-invasive biomedical technologies were employed, including digital artery photoplethysmography for the extraction of cardiovascular signals, near-infrared spectroscopy for the extraction of regional tissue oxygenation in brain and muscle, and electromyography for assessment of timed muscle contractions in the lower limbs. With the novel technique described and exemplified in this paper, we were able to integrate signals from all instruments used in the assessment in a precisely synchronized fashion. We demonstrate that it is possible to visualize the interactions between all different physiological signals during the combined NCVI\\/NMFI assessment. Multiple counts of evidence were collected, which can capture the dynamics between skeletal muscle contractions and neurocardiovascular responses. The proposed multimodal data visualization can offer an overview of the functioning of the muscle pump during both supine rest and orthostatic recovery and can conduct comparison studies with signals from multiple participants at any given time in the assessment. This could help researchers and clinicians generate and test hypotheses based on the multimodal inspection of raw data, in long COVID and other clinical cohorts.\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"},{\"doi\":\"10.1101\\/2021.12.23.21268341\",\"title\":\"Identifying Mitral Valve Prolapse at Risk for Ventricular Arrhythmias and Myocardial Fibrosis from 12-lead Electrocardiograms using Deep Learning\",\"authors\":\"Tison, G.

Complex ventricular ectopy (ComVE) represents a marker of arrhythmic risk that is associated with myocardial fibrosis and increased mortality in MVP. We hypothesize that an ECG-based machine-learning model can identify MVP with ComVE and\\/or myocardial fibrosis on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging.\\n\\nMethodsA deep convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to detect ComVE using 6,916 12-lead ECGs from 569 MVP patients evaluated at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) between 2012 and 2020. A separate CNN was also trained to detect late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) using 87 ECGs from MVP patients with contrast CMR. Results: The prevalence of ComVE was 160\\/569 or 28% (20 patients or 3% had cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death). The area under the curve (AUC) of the CNN to detect ComVE was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.78-0.84). AUC remained high even after excluding patients with moderate-severe mitral regurgitation (MR) [0.80 (95% CI, 0.77-0.83)], or with bileaflet MVP [0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.85)]. The top ECG segments able to discriminate ComVE vs no ComVE were related to ventricular depolarization and repolarization (early-mid ST and QRS fromV1, V3, and III). LGE in the papillary muscles or basal inferolateral wall was present in 21 (24%) of 87 patients with available CMR. The AUC for detection of LGE was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.68-0.82).\\n\\nConclusionsStandard 12-lead ECGs analyzed with machine learning can detect MVP at risk for ventricular arrhythmias and fibrosis and can identify novel ECG correlates of arrhythmic risk regardless of leaflet involvement or mitral regurgitation severity.

It is emphasised that when the \\\"backdoor criteria\\\" from causal-inference applies, if diseases are sufficiently rare, then the proportional hazard model can be used to estimate causal associations. When the \\\"frontdoor criteria\\\" applies (allowing causal estimates with unmeasured confounders), similar estimates are found to mediation analyses with measured confounders. Reasons for this are discussed. An attribution fraction is constructed using the average causal effects (ACE) of exposures on the population, and simple methods for its evaluation are suggested. It differs from the attribution fraction used by the World Health Organisation (WHO), except for specific circumstances where the latter can agree or provide a bound. A counterfactual argument determines an individuals attribution fraction Af in terms of proportional hazard estimates, as Af = 1- 1\\/R, where R is an individuals relative risk. Causally meaningful attribution fractions cannot be constructed for all known risk factors or confounders, but there are important cases where they can. As an example, systematic proportional hazards studies with UK Biobank data estimate the attribution fractions of smoking and BMI for 226 diseases. The attribution of risk is characterised in terms of disease chapters from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), and the diseases most strongly attributed to smoking and BMI are identified. The result is a quantitative characterisation of the causal influence of smoking and BMI on the landscape of disease incidence in the UK Biobank population.\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"},{\"doi\":\"10.1101\\/2021.12.24.21268331\",\"title\":\"Traditional Chinese medicine: A Bayesian network model of public awareness, usage determinants, and perception of scientific support in Austria\",\"authors\":\"Eigenschink, M.; Bellach, L.; Leonard, S.

AD susceptibility has an established genetic basis which has been the focus of a large number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) published over the last decade. Most of these GWAS used dichotomized clinical diagnostic status, i.e. case vs. control classification, as outcome phenotypes, without the use of biomarkers. An alternative and potentially more powerful study design is afforded by using quantitative AD-related phenotypes as GWAS outcome traits, an analysis paradigm that we followed in this work. Specifically, we utilized genotype and phenotype data from n=931 individuals collected under the auspices of the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimers Disease Multimodal Biomarker Discovery (EMIF-AD MBD) study to perform a total of 19 separate GWAS analyses. As outcomes we used five magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) traits and seven cognitive performance traits. For the latter, longitudinal data from at least two timepoints were available in addition to cross-sectional assessments at baseline. Our GWAS analyses revealed several genome-wide significant associations for the neuropsychological performance measures, in particular those assayed longitudinally. Among the most noteworthy signals were associations in or near EHBP1 (EH domain binding protein 1; on chromosome 2p15) and CEP112 (centrosomal protein 112; 17q24.1) with delayed recall in a memory performance test. On the X chromosome, which is often excluded in other GWAS, we identified a genome-wide significant signal near IL1RAPL1 (interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein like 1; Xp21.3). While polygenic score (PGS) analyses showed the expected strong associations with SNPs highlighted in relevant previous GWAS on hippocampal volume and cognitive function, they did not show noteworthy associations with recent AD risk GWAS findings. In summary, our study highlights the power of using quantitative endophenotypes as outcome traits in AD-related GWAS analyses and nominates several new loci not previously implicated in cognitive decline.\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"},{\"doi\":\"10.1101\\/2021.12.24.21268381\",\"title\":\"Assessing the contribution of rare-to-common protein-coding variants to circulating metabolic biomarker levels via 412,394 UK Biobank exome sequences\",\"authors\":\"Nag, A.; Middleton, L.; Dhindsa, R.

For patients 70 or older, we present the incidence of 30-day mortality from COVID-19 in the Stockholm region, in relationship to geriatric hospitalizations and 30-day mortality after admission for COVID-19 and other causes.\\n\\nSettingHospitalizations for patients 70+ from geriatric clinics in Stockholm, Sweden hospitalized for COVID-19 or other causes between March 2020 and July 31, 2021, were included.\\n\\nParticipantsThe total number of geriatric hospitalizations for patients 70+ was 5,320 for COVID-19 and 32,243 for non-COVID-19 causes, corresponding to 4,565 individual COVID-19 patients and 19,308 non-COVID-19 patients.\\n\\nExposure(s)The date of hospital admission to a geriatric clinic. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): 30-day mortality after admission.\\n\\nResultsIn patients with COVID-19, the 30-day mortality rate was highest at the beginning of the first wave (29% in March-April 2020), decreased as the first wave subsided (7% July-August), increased again in the second wave (17% November-December), but failed to increase as much in the third wave (11-13% March-July 2021). In non-COVID-19 geriatric patients during the same period, the 30-day mortality presented a similar trend, but with a smaller magnitude of variation (5 to 10%). The number of persons 70 or older testing positive for COVID-19 in Stockholm reached two peaks in 2020 (April and December), fell in January 2021 and then increased again in March-April 2021.\\n\\nConclusions and RelevanceDuring the first and second waves, hospital admissions and 30-day mortality after geriatric hospitalization for COVID-19 increased in periods of high community transmission, although the mortality peak was lower in wave 2 than in wave 1. The mortality for non-COVID geriatric cases was lower and more stable but also showed an increase with the pandemic peaks.\\n\\nKEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSMultiple previous reports in different countries and settings have shown higher case fatality ratio or hospitalized case fatality ratio for COVID-19 in the first wave compared to the second wave of the pandemic. However, less is known about how the COVID-19 waves specifically affected the care of geriatric patients, including those with conditions other than COVID.\\n\\nFindingsThe total number of hospitalizations was 5,320 for COVID-19 and 32,243 for non-COVID-cases. In COVID-patients, the 30-day mortality rate was highest at the beginning of the first wave (29% in March-April 2020), reached 17% at the second wave peak (November-December) followed by 11-13% in the third wave (March-July 2021). The mortality in non-COVID geriatric patients showed a similar trend, but of lower magnitude (5-10%). During the incidence peaks, COVID-19 hospitalizations displaced non-COVID geriatric patients.\\n\\nMeaningHospital admissions and 30-day mortality after hospitalizations for COVID-19 increased in periods of high community transmission, albeit with decreasing mortality rates from wave 1 to 3, with a possible vaccination effect in wave 3. Thus, the healthcare system could not compensate for the high community spread of COVID-19 during the pandemic peaks, which also led to displacing care for non-COVID geriatric patients. These results are important for planning healthcare resources in future health emergencies.\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"},{\"doi\":\"10.1101\\/2021.12.23.21268061\",\"title\":\"Identifying Medication-related Intents from a Bidirectional Text Messaging Platform for Hypertension Management: An Unsupervised Learning Approach\",\"authors\":\"Davoudi, A.; Lee, N.; Luong, T.; Delaney, T.; Asch, E.; Chaiyachati, K.; Mowery, D.\",\"author_corresponding\":\"Danielle Mowery\",\"author_corresponding_institution\":\"University of Pennsylvania\",\"date\":\"2021-12-27\",\"version\":\"1\",\"type\":\"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT\",\"license\":\"cc_by_nc_nd\",\"category\":\"health informatics\",\"jatsxml\":\"https:\\/\\/www.medrxiv.org\\/content\\/early\\/2021\\/12\\/27\\/2021.12.23.21268061.source.xml\",\"abstract\":\"BackgroundFree-text communication between patients and providers is playing an increasing role in chronic disease management, through platforms varying from traditional healthcare portals to more novel mobile messaging applications. These text data are rich resources for clinical and research purposes, but their sheer volume render them difficult to manage. Even automated approaches such as natural language processing require labor-intensive manual classification for developing training datasets, which is a rate-limiting step. Automated approaches to organizing free-text data are necessary to facilitate the use of free-text communication for clinical care and research.\\n\\nObjectiveWe applied unsupervised learning approaches to 1) understand the types of topics discussed and 2) to learn medication-related intents from messages sent between patients and providers through a bidirectional text messaging system for managing participant blood pressure.\\n\\nMethodsThis study was a secondary analysis of de-identified messages from a remote mobile text-based employee hypertension management program at an academic institution. In experiment 1, we trained a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model for each message type (inbound-patient and outbound-provider) and identified the distribution of major topics and significant topics (probability >0.20) across message types. In experiment 2, we annotated all medication-related messages with a single medication intent. Then, we trained a second LDA model (medLDA) to assess how well the unsupervised method could identify more fine-grained medication intents. We encoded each medication message with n-grams (n-1-3 words) using spaCy, clinical named entities using STANZA, and medication categories using MedEx, and then applied Chi-square feature selection to learn the most informative features associated with each medication intent.\\n\\nResultsA total of 253 participants and 5 providers engaged in the program generating 12,131 total messages: 47% patient messages and 53% provider messages. Most patient messages correspond to blood pressure (BP) reporting, BP encouragement, and appointment scheduling. In contrast, most provider messages correspond to BP reporting, medication adherence, and confirmatory statements. In experiment 1, for both patient and provider messages, most messages contained 1 topic and few with more than 3 topics identified using LDA. However, manual review of some messages within topics revealed significant heterogeneity even within single-topic messages as identified by LDA. In experiment 2, among the 534 medication messages annotated with a single medication intent, most of the 282 patient medication messages referred to medication request (48%; n=134) and medication taking (28%; n=79); most of the 252 provider medication messages referred to medication question (69%; n=173). Although medLDA could identify a majority intent within each topic, the model could not distinguish medication intents with low prevalence within either patient or provider messages. Richer feature engineering identified informative lexical-semantic patterns associated with each medication intent class.\\n\\nConclusionLDA can be an effective method for generating subgroups of messages with similar term usage and facilitate the review of topics to inform annotations. However, few training cases and shared vocabulary between intents precludes the use of LDA for fully automated deep medication intent classification.\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"},{\"doi\":\"10.1101\\/2021.12.22.21268288\",\"title\":\"Elevation of cell-associated HIV-1 RNA transcripts in CSF CD4+ T cells, despite suppressive antiretroviral therapy, is linked to in vivo brain injury\",\"authors\":\"Suzuki, K.; Zaunders, J.; Gates, T.

We quantified cell-associated (CA) HIV-1 RNA-transcripts in CSF and blood, in relation to proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H MRS) of major brain metabolites, in well characterised PLHIV.\\n\\nMethodsRNA was extracted from cells in 16 paired samples of CSF and blood, from PLHIV on fully suppressive ART. HIV-1 CA-RNA copies were measured using the highly sensitive Double-R assay and normalized \\/106 CD4+ T cells. 18-colour flow cytometry was used to count and analyse CD4+ T cells and monocytes in CSF and blood.

We have applied this model to the 2020 dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

When long-distance mobility is suppressed, this policy results in a traveling wave of infections, which we characterize analytically.

The Cohort Size Shrinkage Index (CSSI) is the most widely used measure to examine famine intensity and was used in at least 28 Chinese famine studies to date. We examined the potential impact of violations of three requirements for a valid CSSI measure: reliable information on cohort size by year of birth; a stable trend of cohort size by year of birth; and the absence of significant regional migration. We used data from the 1% China 2000 Census to examine the trend of cohort size over time and concentrated on the time window between 1950-70 to exclude policies and events with a large impact on birth trends other than the famine itself.\\n\\nAcross China we established a significant difference in cohort size trends between pre-famine births and post-famine births, violating one of the main requirements for a valid CSSI measure. This leads to systematic differences in CSSI depending on what non-famine years are selected for comparison. At the province level, CSSIs estimated based on pre- & post-famine births tend to overestimate famine intensity at higher exposure levels and underestimate intensity at lower levels compared to CSSIs based on pre-famine births alone. This is problematic and demonstrates that the CSSI is not as robust an estimator of famine intensity as had been assumed previously. We recommend therefore that all CSSI should be based on pre-famine birth trends.\\n\\nUsing data from Sichuan province, we demonstrate a less pronounced dose-response relation between famine intensity and tuberculosis outcomes using pre-famine based CSSI as compared to reported patterns based on pre- & post-famine based CSSI.

However, how effective this vaccination campaign was at saving lives remains a methodological challenge. In this work, we developed a Bayesian statistical model to estimate the number of deaths and hospitalizations in individuals above 60 years old in Brazil. Using the actual number of hospitalized and deaths from the Brazilian database, and also the coverage of second dose according to the National Immunization Program, we rebuilt the realized scenario as well as the hypothetical scenario without vaccination in Brazil in order to perform a counterfactual analysis. By computing the difference between the hypothetical and realized scenarios, we were able to estimate the direct effect of COVID-19 vaccination in Brazil. We also evaluated two other hypothetical, but not impossible, scenarios considering earlier vaccination roll-outs. We estimated that more than 165 thousand of 60+ years old individuals were not hospitalized due to COVID-19 until August 28, 2021, and other approximately 100 thousand individuals could not have been hospitalized if the immunization started as soon it was approved in Brazil. We also estimate that more than 75 thousand lives were saved in the period analysed for the same age group, and additional 48 thousand lives could have been saved if the Brazilian Government started the immunization 8 weeks earlier.\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"},{\"doi\":\"10.1101\\/2021.12.22.21268217\",\"title\":\"Humoral Immunogenicity of Three COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Doses in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease\",\"authors\":\"Schell, T.

The effects of suboptimal maternal body mass index (BMI), preterm birth, and infection on placental histopathological phenotypes remain unclear, despite the association between these conditions and poor offspring outcomes. We hypothesized that suboptimal maternal prepregnancy BMI and preterm birth (with and without infection) would associate with altered placental maturity and morphometry, and that altered placental maturity would associate with poor birth outcomes. Clinical data and human placentae were collected from 96 pregnancies where mothers were underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese, without other major complications. Placental histopathological characteristics were scored with an anatomical pathologist. Associations between maternal BMI, placental pathology (immaturity and hypermaturity), placental morphometry, and infant outcomes were investigated at term and preterm, with and without infection. Fetal vascular endothelium volumetric proportion was decreased, whereas syncytial knot volumetric proportion was increased, in placentae from preterm pregnancies with chorioamnionitis compared to term placentae. At term and preterm, pregnancies with overweight and obesity had a high percentage increase in proportion of immature placentae compared to normal weight. Placental maturity did not associate with infant birth outcomes. We observed placental hypermaturity and altered placental morphometry among preterm pregnancies with chorioamnionitis, suggestive of altered placental development, which may inform about pregnancies susceptible to preterm birth and infection.

However, no gold standard detection method with high levels of sensitivity or specificity is currently available. Several intrinsic features of triatomine bug behaviour and the lifecycle of Trypanosoma (T.) cruzi lead to deposition of environmental DNA (eDNA) in infested houses. This study evaluated the use of FTA cards and cotton-tipped swabs as low-technology, cost-effective tools for simultaneous detection of T. cruzi and vector eDNA in the laboratory and field.\\n\\nMethods\\/Principal FindingsThis study had two components: (1) laboratory evaluation and optimisation of QIAcard(R) FTA(R) classic cards to detect Rhodnius (R.) prolixus eDNA by altering five different environmental variables (darkness, triatomine number, temperature, feeding status and degradation at ambient temperature); (2) detection of R. prolixus and T. cruzi eDNA from cotton-tipped house wall swabs from an endemic region in Casanare Department, Colombia. eDNA was extracted from all specimens and amplified using a multiplex TaqMan qPCR assay targeting the R. prolixus 12S rRNA gene and T. cruzi satellite DNA region. R. prolixus eDNA from five 3rd\\/4th instar nymphs was successfully amplified from FTA cards after as little as 15 minutes of contact time under standard insectary conditions. Factors significantly increasing eDNA detection from FTA cards were increasing temperature from 21{degrees}C to 27-32{degrees}C, triatomine bug density from 1-25 bugs and recent blood-feeding. eDNA was detectable from FTA cards stored at room temperature for at least two weeks. In cotton-tipped swabs from the field, the sensitivity and specificity of R. prolixus eDNA detection was 60.6% (n=20\\/33) and 100% (n=33\\/33), respectively. T. cruzi eDNA was amplified from 93.9% (n=31\\/33) of infested houses.\\n\\nConclusions\\/SignificanceFTA cards are a highly sensitive tool for entomological surveillance of R. prolixus and exhibit little variability under different environmental conditions. Additionally, cotton-tipped swabs are a relatively sensitive tool for entomological and parasitological surveillance of R. prolixus and T. cruzi in situ, but more feasible due to low cost. Both methods could be utilised by citizen science initiatives to contribute to the control of Chagas disease in endemic communities.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryChagas disease vector control relies on prompt, accurate identification of houses infested with triatomine bugs for targeted insecticide spraying. However, most current detection methods are laborious, lack standardization, have substantial operational costs and limited sensitivity, especially when triatomine bug densities are low or highly focal. We evaluated the use of FTA cards or cotton-tipped swabs to develop a low-technology, non-invasive method of detecting environmental DNA (eDNA) from both triatomine bugs and Trypanosoma cruzi for use in household surveillance in eastern Colombia, an endemic region for Chagas disease. Study findings demonstrated that FTA cards are a sensitive tool for detection of Rhodnius prolixus eDNA at temperatures between 21-32{degrees}C, deposited by individual, recently blood-fed nymphs. Additionally, cotton-tipped swabs are a relatively sensitive tool for field sampling of both T. cruzi and R. prolixus eDNA in infested households and are arguably more feasible due to their lower cost. eDNA detection should not yet replace current surveillance tools, but instead be evaluated in parallel as a more sensitive, higher-throughput, lower cost alternative. eDNA collection requires virtually no skills or resources in situ and therefore has the potential to be implemented in local endemic communities as part of citizen science initiatives to control Chagas disease transmission.\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"},{\"doi\":\"10.1101\\/2021.12.21.21268075\",\"title\":\"Assessing Immunity by Quantitative Measurement of SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibodies in Fingerstick Samples\",\"authors\":\"Garza, J.

The response to the pandemic has focused on preventing the spread of the disease and improving treatment options. Diagnostic technologies have played a key role in this response since the beginning of the pandemic. As vaccines and other treatments have been developed and deployed, interest in understanding and measuring the individual level of immune protection has increased. Historically, use of antibody titers to measure systemic immunity has been constrained by an incomplete understanding of the relationship between antibodies and immunity, the lack of international standards for antibody concentration to enable cross-study comparisons, and insufficient clinical data to allow for the development of robust antibody-immunity models.\\n\\nHowever, these constraints have recently shifted. With a deeper understanding of antibodies, the promulgation of WHO antibody standards, and the development of immunity models using datasets from multiple COVID-19 vaccine trials, certain types of quantitative antibody tests may now provide a way to monitor individual or community immunity against COVID-19. Specifically, tests that quantitate the concentration of anti-RBD IgG -antibodies that target the receptor binding domain of the S1 spike protein component of the SARS-CoV-2 virus - show promise as a useful and scalable measure of the COVID-19 immunity of both individuals and communities. However, to fulfill this promise, a rapid and easy-to-administer test is needed.\\n\\nTo address this important clinical need, Brevitest deployed its point-of-care-capable technology platform that can run a rapid (<15 minute), quantitative antibody test with a sample of 10 l of whole blood from a fingerstick. The test we validated on this platform measures the concentration of anti-RBD IgG in Binding Antibody Units per milliliter (BAU\\/mL) per WHO Reference Standard NIBSC 20\\/136.\\n\\nIn this paper, we present studies used to characterize the Brevitest anti-RBD IgG assay and evaluate its clinical performance, lower limits of measurement, precision, linearity, interference, and cross-reactivity. The results demonstrate the ability of this assay to measure a patients anti-RBD IgG concentration. This information, together with models developed from recent COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, can provide a means of assessing the current level of immune protection of an individual or community against COVID-19 infection.\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"},{\"doi\":\"10.1101\\/2021.12.23.21268177\",\"title\":\"Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in MS patients on disease modifying therapies\",\"authors\":\"Sormani, M.

As only few reports have described their prognosis more than 6 months later, the main objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of OD and GD 11 months after COVID-19. We also aimed to determine test-retest reliability of subjective chemosensory ratings for the follow-up of chemosensory sensitivity, as this measure is often used for remote follow-up.\\n\\nMethodsInclusion criteria included a PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; exclusion criteria were the presence of other respiratory infections and chronic sinusitis. To assess whether OD and GD had changed compared to pre-pandemic levels, we designed an observational study and distributed an online questionnaire assessing quantitative chemosensory function to healthcare workers 5 and 11 months after COVID-19. Specifically, we assessed olfaction, gustation, and trigeminal sensitivity (10-point visual analog scale) and function (4-point Likert scale) separately. We further assessed clinically relevant OD using the Chemosensory Perception Test, a psychophysical test designed to provide a reliable remote olfactory evaluation. Qualitative chemosensory dysfunction was also assessed.\\n\\nResultsWe included a total of 366 participants (mean age of 44.8 years old (SD: 11.7)). They completed the last online questionnaire 10.6 months (SD: 0.7) after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Of all participants, 307 (83.9%) and 301 (82.2%) individuals retrospectively reported lower olfactory or gustatory sensitivity during the acute phase of COVID-19. Eleven months later, 184 (50.3%) and 163 (44.5%) indicated reduced chemosensory sensitivity, 32.2% reported impairment of olfactory function while 24.9% exhibited clinically relevant OD. Three variables predicted OD at follow-up, namely chest pain and GD during COVID-19 and presence of phantosmia at 5 months. Olfactory sensitivity ratings had a high test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.818 (95% CI: 0.760 - 0.860))\\n\\nDiscussionThis study suggests that chemosensory dysfunctions persist in a third of COVID-19 patients 11 months after COVID-19. Subjective measures have a high test-retest reliability and thus can be used to monitor post-COVID-19 OD. OD appears to be a common long-term symptom of COVID-19 important to consider when treating patients.\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"},{\"doi\":\"10.1101\\/2021.12.20.21268000\",\"title\":\"ESBL plasmids in Klebsiella pneumoniae: diversity, transmission, and contribution to infection burden in the hospital setting\",\"authors\":\"Hawkey, J.; Wyres, K.

Among students in Indonesia, college students have a population of almost 8.3 million. Considering the massive numbers of college students, school reopening should be supported by adequate COVID-19 vaccination. As a result, the first dose of the inactivated virus COVID-19 vaccine has been administered, including to college students aged over 18 years old. While COVID-19 vaccination is widely available, there is still a scarcity of information on post-vaccination symptoms. As reported from other locations, post vaccination has been reported. Then, this study aims to assess the common symptoms of COVID-19 1st dose vaccinations among the following groups: gender (male and female college students), age, body weight, and height. The observed symptoms include sore arms, fatigue, headache, fever with a body temperature above 38 {degrees}C, nausea, shivering, and muscle joint pain. Participants in this study were students at the university. They were considered eligible for this study if they were currently enrolled at university, were at least 19 years of age, and provided informed consent. The data was recorded using a standardized online questionnaire. The answers were collected in an online database. At the beginning of the questionnaire, subjects or students were informed that data would be collected anonymously. Based on the results, the symptoms were different between female and male students. In fact, female students have experienced more symptoms than male students. While male students only suffered sore arms (68%) followed by headache symptoms (32%). Similar to male students, sore arms are the most common symptom observed among female students. Among female students, from the most to the least common symptoms observed from 20 years of age in this study are sore arms at site reaction > headache > fatigue > fever > muscle joint pain > shivering > nausea.

We combine these fully unsupervised analyses with machine learning to identify features in the pre-treatment data that are prognostic for risk of relapse. We find significant topological differences between relapsing and non-relapsing patients and confirm the predictive power of CD10, CD20, CD38, and CD45.

Genome sequencing is a critical tool, as other biological techniques can be more costly, time-consuming, and difficult. However, the rapid and complex evolution of SARS-CoV-2 challenges conventional sequence analysis methods like phylogenetic analysis. The virus picks up and loses mutations independently in multiple subclades, often in novel or unexpected combinations, and, as for the newly emerged Omicron variant, sometimes with long explained branches. We propose interpretable deep sequence models trained by machine learning to complement conventional methods. We apply Transformer-based neural network models developed for natural language processing to analyze protein sequences. We add network layers to generate sample embeddings and sequence-wide attention to interpret models and visualize multiscale patterns. We demonstrate and validate our framework by modeling SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus taxonomy. We then develop an interpretable predictive model of disease severity that integrates SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence and patient demographic variables, using publicly available data from the GISAID database. We also apply our model to Omicron. Based on knowledge prior to the availability of empirical data for Omicron, we predict: 1) reduced neutralization antibody activity (15-50 fold) greater than any previously characterized variant, varying between Omicron sublineages, and 2) reduced risk of severe disease (by 35-40%) relative to Delta.

We followed them for up to 30 days after their second dose of an mRNA vaccine to identify encounters for myocarditis, pericarditis or myopericarditis. We compared two identification methods: A method that searched all encounter diagnoses using a brief text description (e.g., ICD-10-CM code I40.9 is defined as  acute myocarditis, unspecified). We searched the text description of all inpatient or outpatient encounter diagnoses (in any position) for \\\"myocarditis\\\" or \\\"pericarditis.\\\" The other method was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), which searched for emergency department visits or hospitalizations with a select set of discharge ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. For both methods, two physicians independently reviewed the identified patient records and classified them as confirmed, probable or not cases using the CDCs case definition.\\n\\nResultsThe encounter methodology identified 14 distinct patients who met the confirmed or probable CDC case definition for acute myocarditis or pericarditis with an onset within 21 days of receipt of COVID-19 vaccination. Three of these 14 patients had an ICD-10 code of I51.4 \\\"Myocarditis, Unspecified\\\" which was overlooked by the VSD algorithm. The VSD methodology identified 11 patients who met the CDC case definition for acute myocarditis or pericarditis. Seven (64%) of the eleven patients had initial care for myopericarditis outside of a KPNW facility and their diagnosis could not be ascertained by the VSD methodology until claims were submitted (median delay of 33 days; range of 12-195 days).

Although 20% of CD4+ T cell epitopes are potentially affected, the loss of immunity mediated by CD4+ T cells is estimated to be slightly above 30% as some of the affected epitopes are relatively more immunogenic.

Combined with the expected substantial loss of neutralization from antibodies, the overall protection provided by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines could be impacted adversely. From analysis of prior variants, the efficacy of vaccines against symptomatic infection has been largely maintained and is strongly correlated with the T cell response but not as strongly with the neutralizing antibody response.

In Canada, despite relatively high vaccine availability and uptake, willingness to accept booster shots and maintain mitigation behaviors in the post-acute phase of COVID-19 remain uncertain. The aim of the Canadian COVID-19 Experiences Project (CCEP) is two-fold: 1) to identify social-cognitive and neurocognitive correlates of vaccine hesitancy and mitigation behaviors, and 2) to identify optimal communication strategies to promote vaccination and mitigation behaviors into the post-acute phase of the pandemic.\\n\\nMethods and analysesThe CCEP is comprised of two components: a conventional population survey (Study 1) and a functionally interconnected laboratory study (Study 2). Study 1 will involve 3 waves of data collection. Wave 1, completed between 28 September and 21 October, 2021, recruited 1,958 vaccine-hesitant (49.8%) and fully vaccinated (50.2%) adults using quota sampling to ensure maximum statistical power. Measures included a variety of social cognitive (e.g., beliefs, intentions) and neurocognitive (e.g., delay discounting) measures, followed by an opportunity to view and rate a set of professionally produced COVID-19 public service announcement (PSA) videos for perceived efficacy. Study 2 employs the same survey items and PSAs but coupled with lab-based eye tracking and functional brain imaging to directly quantify neural indicators of attention capture and self-reflection in a smaller community sample. In the final phase of the project, subjective impressions and neural indicators of PSA efficacy will be compared and used to inform recommendations for construction of COVID-19 PSAs into the post-acute phase of the pandemic.\\n\\nEthics and disseminationThe CCEP has received ethical review and approval by the University of Waterloo Office of Research Ethics.

Several studies were identified that investigated waning of immunity in healthy adults. It is well established through epidemiology and serology studies that in healthy adults, the protection conferred by the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine (Pfizer\\/BioNtech) wanes significantly after several months. Studies have also shown that the immune response to the vaccine varies with age, and that after the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, the older adult population (65-85 years of age) typically has a lower immune response (as reflected in an analysis of anti-spike IgG antibodies and neutralising antibody titres), than younger adults (18-55 years of age), and that the immunity wanes in all age groups within several months.\\n\\nAdded value of this studyThis is, to our knowledge, the first study that examined anti-spike IgG and neutralising antibody titres three months after the third BNT162b2 vaccine dose. The study has demonstrated that three months after that dose, participants, who were healthy adults aged 60 years and older, remained anti-spike IgG seropositive, although a significant decrease in anti-spike IgG titres was observed (compared to two weeks after the third dose). In addition, a statistically significant correlation was observed between the neutralising antibody titres and the anti-spike IgG titres, and all participants were seropositive for neutralising antibodies three months after the third dose.

When combined with echocardiographic abnormalities, PVCs during recovery was only associated with increased risk when such were present (adjusted HR 3.3 [2.0-5.4], p<0.001), and not when absent (adjusted HR 1.4 [0.7-2.6], p=0.26), in reference to those with neither.\\n\\nConclusionPVCs during recovery was associated with increased prevalence of echocardiographic abnormalities. Increased risk of cardiovascular mortality was observed only for subjects with PVCs if concomitant echocardiographic abnormalities were present. This provides a structural explanation for the increased long-term cardiovascular risk among patients with PVCs during recovery.\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"},{\"doi\":\"10.1101\\/2021.12.25.21268390\",\"title\":\"Associations of mitochondrial DNA copy number with incident risks of gastrointestinal cancers: a prospective case-cohort study\",\"authors\":\"Guan, X.; Li, M.; Bai, Y.; Feng, Y.; Li, G.; Wei, W.; Fu, M.; Li, H.; Wang, C.; Jie, J.; Meng, H.; Wu, X.; Deng, Q.; Li, F.; Yang, H.; Zhang, X.; He, M.; Guo, H.\",\"author_corresponding\":\"Huan Guo\",\"author_corresponding_institution\":\"Huazhong University of Science and Technology\",\"date\":\"2021-12-27\",\"version\":\"1\",\"type\":\"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT\",\"license\":\"cc_no\",\"category\":\"epidemiology\",\"jatsxml\":\"https:\\/\\/www.medrxiv.org\\/content\\/early\\/2021\\/12\\/27\\/2021.12.25.21268390.source.xml\",\"abstract\":\"BackgroundEpidemiological investigations implied that inter-individual variations of mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) could trigger predisposition to multiple cancers, but evidence regarding gastrointestinal cancers (GICs) was still uncertain.\\n\\nMethodsWe conducted a case-cohort study within the prospective Dongfeng-Tongji cohort, including incident cases of colorectal cancer (CRC, n=278), gastric cancer (GC, n=138), and esophageal cancer (EC, n=72) as well as a random subcohort (n=1173), who were followed up from baseline to the end of 2018.

Grubbs and Iglewicz-Hoaglin tests were used to identify the statistical differences between the predicted and observed deaths. The relationship between mortality and predictive variables was assessed using OLS multiple regression models.\\n\\nResultsBoth ARIMA and OLS linear regression models predicted the number of deaths in Italy during 2020 to be between 640,000 and 660,000 (95% confidence intervals range: 620,000 - 695,000) and these values were far from the observed deaths reported (above 750,000). Significant difference in deaths at national level (P = 0.003), and higher male mortality than women (+18% versus +14%, P < 0.001 versus P = 0.01) was observed.

Inferring lineage prevalence by clinical testing is infeasible at scale, especially in areas with limited resources, participation, or testing\\/sequencing capacity, which can also introduce biases. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater successfully tracks regional infection dynamics and provides less biased abundance estimates than clinical testing. Tracking virus genomic sequences in wastewater would improve community prevalence estimates and detect emerging variants. However, two factors limit wastewater-based genomic surveillance: low-quality sequence data and inability to estimate relative lineage abundance in mixed samples. Here, we resolve these critical issues to perform a high-resolution, 295-day wastewater and clinical sequencing effort, in the controlled environment of a large university campus and the broader context of the surrounding county. We develop and deploy improved virus concentration protocols and deconvolution software that fully resolve multiple virus strains from wastewater. We detect emerging variants of concern up to 14 days earlier in wastewater samples, and identify multiple instances of virus spread not captured by clinical genomic surveillance.

This study aimed at determining the Health Effects of Chunga Dumpsite on surrounding communities in Lusaka, Zambia.\\n\\nDesign and MethodsThis was a mixed method design and employed a cross sectional approach and case study conducted concurrently. Communities were stratified by distance into Stratum One (within 250 meters radius) and Two (above 250 to 500 meters). Quantitative data were collected from total 200 households thus 100 households from each stratum by using self-administered questionnaires. Qualitative data were collected from Two Key informants from the Local Authority and 15 participants using semi-structured interview guide. Both data were collected from December 22nd, 2018 to February 18th, 2019.\\n\\nResultsResults revealed that smoke and various gasses emitted from burning and decomposing waste compromised quality of air in surrounding communities. Communities were infested with flies, mosquitoes and vermin. Consequently, (73.5%) complained of persistent coughing, (65.1%) suffered from malaria, (72.6%) complained of persistent headaches and (62.2%) had frequent diarrhoea cases in stratum one. Respiratory problems were more pronounced at night possibly due to high humidity which hindered pollutants to easily escape.

Since monkeypox in humans was initially diagnosed in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), it has spread to other regions of Africa (primarily West and Central), and cases outside Africa have emerged in recent years. We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature on how monkeypox epidemiology has evolved, with particular emphasis on the number of confirmed, probable, and\\/or possible cases, age at presentation, mortality, and geographical spread. The review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020208269). We identified 48 peer-reviewed articles and 18 grey literature sources for data extraction. The number of human monkeypox cases has been on the rise since the 1970s, with the most dramatic increases occurring in the DRC. The median age at presentation has increased from 4 (1970s) to 21 years (2010-2019). There was an overall case fatality rate of 8.7%, with a significant difference between clades -- Central African 10.6% (95% CI: 8.4% - 13.3%) vs. West African 3.6% (95% CI: 1.7% - 6.8%). Since 2003, import- and travel-related spread outside of Africa has occasionally resulted in outbreaks. Interactions\\/activities with infected animals or individuals are risk behaviors associated with acquiring monkeypox. Our review shows an escalation of monkeypox cases, especially in the highly endemic DRC, a spread to other countries, and a growing median age from young children to young adults. These findings may be related to the cessation of smallpox vaccination, which provided some cross-protection against monkeypox, leading to increased human-to-human transmission. The appearance of outbreaks beyond Africa highlights the global relevance of the disease. Increased surveillance and detection of monkeypox cases are essential tools for understanding the continuously changing epidemiology of this resurging disease.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMonkeypox, a zoonotic disease caused by an orthopoxvirus, results in a smallpox-like disease in humans. We conducted a systematic review to assess how monkeypox epidemiology has evolved since it was first diagnosed in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In total, human monkeypox has now appeared in 10 African countries and 4 countries elsewhere. Examples include Nigeria, where the disease re-emerged in the last decade after a 40-year hiatus, and the United States, where an outbreak occurred in 2003. The number of cases has increased at a minimum of 10-fold and median age at presentation has evolved from young children (4 years old) in the 1970s to young adults (21 years old) in 2010-2019. This may be related to the cessation of smallpox vaccinations, which provided some cross-protection against monkeypox. The case fatality rate for the Central African clade was 10.6% versus 3.6% for the West African clade. Overall, monkeypox is gradually evolving to become of global relevance. Surveillance and detection programs are essential tools for understanding the continuously changing epidemiology of this resurging disease.\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"},{\"doi\":\"10.1101\\/2021.12.26.21268426\",\"title\":\"Pandemic-related decline in injuries related to women wearing high-heeled shoes: Analysis of U.S. data for 2016-2020\",\"authors\":\"Cohen, P.

It has been included in the category of the six biggest causes of worldwide death, but self-control of treatment and obedience to self-care is still low. One of the influencing factors is related to the lack of knowledge. Providing ongoing health education is one of the solutions or efforts to strengthen knowledge in type 2 diabetes. The aim was to identify the various health education methods currently used by nurses and their impacts on type 2 DM. The method used is a literature review. The literature was searched on data based on Scopus, Web of Science, SAGE, CINAHL with the keywords \\\"methods\\\" or \\\"interventions\\\", \\\"education\\\", \\\"health\\\", \\\"nursing\\\", and \\\"type 2 diabetes melitus. Fifteen (15) pieces of literature were considered to meet the criteria inclusion.\\n\\nResultsThree (3) types of health education methods used by nurses were identified: 1). Direct health education refers to providing education by nurses to patients through training, coaching, interviews, Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and home visits; 2).

Omicron infections are rapidly expanding worldwide often in the face of high levels of Delta infections. Here we characterized developing immunity to Omicron and investigated whether neutralizing immunity elicited by Omicron also enhances neutralizing immunity of the Delta variant. We enrolled both previously vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the Omicron infection wave in South Africa soon after symptom onset. We then measured their ability to neutralize both Omicron and Delta virus at enrollment versus a median of 14 days after enrollment. Neutralization of Omicron increased 14-fold over this time, showing a developing antibody response to the variant. Importantly, there was an enhancement of Delta virus neutralization, which increased 4.4-fold. The increase in Delta variant neutralization in individuals infected with Omicron may result in decreased ability of Delta to re-infect those individuals. Along with emerging data indicating that Omicron, at this time in the pandemic, is less pathogenic than Delta, such an outcome may have positive implications in terms of decreasing the Covid-19 burden of severe disease.\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"},{\"doi\":\"10.1101\\/2021.12.26.21268380\",\"title\":\"SARS-CoV-2 spike T cell responses induced upon vaccination or infection remain robust against Omicron\",\"authors\":\"Keeton, R.; Tincho, M.

The extent to which other components of the adaptive response such as T cells may still target Omicron and contribute to protection from severe outcomes is unknown. We assessed the ability of T cells to react with Omicron spike in participants who were vaccinated with Ad26.CoV2.S or BNT162b2, and in unvaccinated convalescent COVID-19 patients (n = 70). We found that 70-80% of the CD4 and CD8 T cell response to spike was maintained across study groups. Moreover, the magnitude of Omicron cross-reactive T cells was similar to that of the Beta and Delta variants, despite Omicron harbouring considerably more mutations. Additionally, in Omicron-infected hospitalized patients (n = 19), there were comparable T cell responses to ancestral spike, nucleocapsid and membrane proteins to those found in patients hospitalized in previous waves dominated by the ancestral, Beta or Delta variants (n = 49). These results demonstrate that despite Omicrons extensive mutations and reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies, the majority of T cell response, induced by vaccination or natural infection, cross-recognises the variant. Well-preserved T cell immunity to Omicron is likely to contribute to protection from severe COVID-19, supporting early clinical observations from South Africa.\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"},{\"doi\":\"10.1101\\/2021.12.28.21268477\",\"title\":\"Safety and immunogenicity of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in Japanese patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.\",\"authors\":\"Watanabe, M.; Yakushijin, K.; Funakoshi, Y.; Ohji, G.; Sakai, H.; Hojo, W.; Saeki, M.; Hirakawa, Y.; Matsumoto, S.; Sakai, R.; Nagao, S.; Kitao, A.; Miyata, Y.; Koyama, T.; Saito, Y.; Kawamoto, S.; Ito, M.; Murayama, T.; Matsuoka, H.; Minami, H.\",\"author_corresponding\":\"Kimikazu Yakushijin\",\"author_corresponding_institution\":\"Division of Medical Oncology\\/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Hospital and Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan\",\"date\":\"2021-12-29\",\"version\":\"1\",\"type\":\"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT\",\"license\":\"cc_no\",\"category\":\"hematology\",\"jatsxml\":\"https:\\/\\/www.medrxiv.org\\/content\\/early\\/2021\\/12\\/29\\/2021.12.28.21268477.source.xml\",\"abstract\":\"Patients who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for hematological disease experience high mortality when infected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

However, these studies often lack both baseline pre-COVID-19 assessments and a control group and could therefore simply reflect preexisting risk factors. Right before the COVID-19 outbreak, we completed an olfactory focused study including structural MR brain images and a full clinical olfactory test. Opportunistically, we invited participants back one year later, including 9 participants who had experienced mild to medium COVID-19 (C19+) and 12 that had not (C19-), thereby creating a pre-post controlled natural experiment with a control group. Despite C19+ participants reporting subjective olfactory dysfunction, few showed signs of objectively altered function one year later. Critically, all but one individual in the C19+ group had reduced olfactory bulb volume with an average volume reduction of 14.3%, but this did not amount to a significant between group difference compared to the control group (2.3% reduction) using inference statistics. No morphological differences in cerebral olfactory areas were found but we found stronger functional connectivity between olfactory brain areas in the C19+ croup at the post measure. Taken together, these data suggest that COVID-19 might cause a long-term reduction in olfactory bulb volume but with no discernible differences in cerebral olfactory regions.\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"},{\"doi\":\"10.1101\\/2021.12.23.21268152\",\"title\":\"A Pilot Basket Study to Evaluate Multi-Analyte Liquid Biopsies for Personalized Treatments in Advanced Refractory Cancers\",\"authors\":\"Nagarkar, R.; Crook, T.; Plowman, N.; Gaya, A.; Patil, D.; Akolkar, D.; Palwe, V.; Pandit, P.; Kate, S.; Roy, S.; Srivastava, N.; Datta, V.; Bose, C.; Patil, S.; Apurwa, S.; Srinivasan, A.; Datar, R.\",\"author_corresponding\":\"Ajay Srinivasan\",\"author_corresponding_institution\":\"Datar Cancer Genetics, Nasik, India\",\"date\":\"2021-12-29\",\"version\":\"1\",\"type\":\"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT\",\"license\":\"cc_by\",\"category\":\"oncology\",\"jatsxml\":\"https:\\/\\/www.medrxiv.org\\/content\\/early\\/2021\\/12\\/29\\/2021.12.23.21268152.source.xml\",\"abstract\":\"AbstarctPrior attempts at personalizing anticancer treatments based on univariate tumor profiling ( single gene variant) for selection of monotherapy with targeted agents ( single drug) have generally yielded poor response rates.

This variant was estimated to be responsible for more than 96% of cases reported between January and June 2021, being associated with increased transmissibility and disease severity, a reduction in neutralization antibodies and effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, as well as diagnostic detection failure. Here we show that, following several importations predominantly from the USA, the Delta variant rapidly replaced Gamma after July 2021. However, in contrast to what was seen in other countries, the rapid spread of Delta did not lead to a large increase in the number of cases and deaths reported in Brazil. We suggest that this was likely due to the relatively successful early vaccination campaign coupled with natural immunity acquired following prior infection with Gamma. Our data reinforces reports of the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant and, considering the increasing concern due to the recently identified Omicron variant, argues for the necessity to strengthen genomic monitoring on a national level to quickly detect and curb the emergence and spread of other VOCs that might threaten global health.\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"},{\"doi\":\"10.1101\\/2021.12.26.21268421\",\"title\":\"Relationship between temperature and relative humidity on the initial spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Brazil\",\"authors\":\"Olinto, M.

Thus, this study aims to evaluate the impact of temperature and relative humidity on COVID-19 cases and deaths during the initial phase of the epidemic in Brazil.\\n\\nMethodologyThis is an ecological study based on secondary data. Daily data on new COVID-19 cases and deaths and on climate indicators was collected from February 20th to April 18th, 2020 (n=59 days), for all state capital cities in Brazil and the Federal District (Brasilia). The studied climate indicators included mean temperature, temperature amplitude, mean relative humidity, relative humidity amplitude, and percentage of days with mean relative humidity less than or equal to 65%. Correlation and multiple linear regression analysis were performed for all cities and was also stratified by quintiles of the COVID-19 incidence rate.\\n\\nResultsMean daily temperature was positively correlated with the number of days until the first COVID-19 case was reported. A lower mean relative humidity was correlated with lower number of cases and deaths in Brazil, especially when the relative humidity was less than or equal to 65%. Higher temperatures and humidity amplitudes were correlated with lower COVID-19 mortality. Additionally, after controlling for humidity, cumulative cases of COVID-19 were inversely associated with temperature in cities with mean temperatures less than 25.8 {degrees}C.\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings indicate that variations in temperature and humidity across the Brazilian territory may have influenced the spread of the novel coronavirus during the initial phase of the epidemic in the country.\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"},{\"doi\":\"10.1101\\/2021.12.27.21268312\",\"title\":\"Mechanically ventilated patients shed high titre live SARS-CoV2 for extended periods from both the upper and lower respiratory tract\",\"authors\":\"Saud, Z.; PONSFORD, M.

As a virus that transmits by respiratory droplets and aerosols, determining the duration of viable virus shedding from the respiratory tract is critical for patient prognosis, and informs infection control measures both within healthcare settings and the public domain.\\n\\nMethodsWe examined upper and lower airway respiratory secretions for both viral RNA and infectious virions in mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the intensive care unit of the University Hospital of Wales. Samples were taken from the oral cavity (saliva), oropharynx (sub-glottic aspirate), or lower respiratory tract (non-directed bronchoalveolar lavage (NBL) or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)) and analyzed by both qPCR and plaque assay.\\n\\nResults117 samples were obtained from 25 patients. qPCR showed extremely high rates of positivity across all sample types, however live virus was far more common in saliva (68%) than in BAL\\/NBAL (32%). Average titres of live virus were higher in subglottic aspirates (4.5x107) than in saliva (2.2x106) or BAL\\/NBAL (8.5x106), and reached >108 PFU\\/ml in some samples.

Omicron variant is characterized by 30 amino acid changes, three small deletions and one small insertion in the Spike protein. In this study, we have identified the Core Unique Peptides (CrUPs) that reside exclusively in the Omicron variant of Spike protein and are absent from the human proteome, thus creating a new dataset of peptides named as C\\/H-CrUPs. Furthermore, we have analyzed their protein locations and compared them with the respective ones of Alpha and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants. In Omicron, 115 C\\/H-CrUPs were generated and 119 C\\/H-CrUPs were lost, almost four times as many compared to the other two variants. From position 440 to position 508, at the Receptor Binding Motif (RBM), 8 mutations were detected, resulting in the construction of 28 novel C\\/H-CrUPs. Most importantly, in Omicron variant, new C\\/H-CrUPs carrying two or three mutant amino acids were produced, as a consequence of the accumulation of multiple mutations in the RBM. Remarkably, these Omicron-derived C\\/H-CrUPs that bear several mutated amino acids could not be recognized in any other viral Spike variant. We suggest that virus binding to the ACE2 receptor is facilitated by the herein identified C\\/H-CrUPs in contact point mutations and Spike-cleavage sites, while the immunoregulatory NF9 peptide is not detectably affected. Taken together, our findings indicate that Omicron variant contains intrinsic abilities to escape immune-system attack, while its mutations can mediate strong viral binding to the ACE2 receptor, leading to highly efficient fusion of the virus to the target cell. However, the intact NF9 peptide suggests that Omicron exhibits reduced pathogenicity compared to Delta variant.\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"},{\"doi\":\"10.1101\\/2021.12.22.21268006\",\"title\":\"Mechanism of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) revealed by targeted removal of legacy bisphosphonate from jawbone using equilibrium competing inert hydroxymethylene diphosphonate\",\"authors\":\"Okawa, H.; Kondo, T.; Hokugo, A.; Cherian, P.; Campagna, J.

Although it is rare, BRONJ has caused apprehension among patients and healthcare providers and decreased acceptance of this anti-resorptive drug class to treat osteoporosis and metastatic osteolysis. We report here a novel method to elucidate the pathological mechanism of BRONJ by the selective removal of legacy N-BP from the jawbone using an intra-oral application of hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (HMDP) formulated in deformable nanoscale vesicles (DNV). After maxillary tooth extraction, zoledronate-treated mice developed delayed gingival wound closure, delayed tooth extraction socket healing and increased jawbone osteonecrosis consistent with human BRONJ lesion. Single cell RNA sequencing of mouse gingival cells revealed oral barrier immune dysregulation and unresolved pro-inflammatory reaction. HMDP-DNV topical applications to nascent mouse BRONJ lesions resulted in accelerated gingival wound closure and bone socket healing as well as attenuation of osteonecrosis development. The gingival single cell RNA sequencing demonstrated resolution of chronic inflammation by increased anti-inflammatory signature gene expression of lymphocytes and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. This study suggests that BRONJ pathology was predominantly induced by the oral N-BP and demonstrates the potential of HMDP-DNV as an effective BRONJ therapy.\\n\\nBrief SummaryThe targeted removal of legacy bisphosphonate from the jawbone by competitive equilibrium therapy elucidated the pathological mechanism of aberrant oral barrier immunity and bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ)\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"},{\"doi\":\"10.1101\\/2021.12.27.21268464\",\"title\":\"Control Strategies for the Third wave of COVID-19 infection in India: A Mathematical Model Incorporating Vaccine Effectiveness\",\"authors\":\"A Sivadas, N.; Mahajan, A.; Panda, P.\",\"author_corresponding\":\"Namitha A Sivadas\",\"author_corresponding_institution\":\"Vellore Institute of Technology\",\"date\":\"2021-12-29\",\"version\":\"1\",\"type\":\"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT\",\"license\":\"cc_by\",\"category\":\"epidemiology\",\"jatsxml\":\"https:\\/\\/www.medrxiv.org\\/content\\/early\\/2021\\/12\\/29\\/2021.12.27.21268464.source.xml\",\"abstract\":\"The waning effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines and the emergence of a new variant Omicron has given rise to the possibility of another outbreak of the infection in India. COVID-19 has caused more than 34 million reported cases and 475 thousand deaths in India so far, and it has affected the country at the root level, socially as well as economically. After going through different control measures, mass vaccination has been achieved to a large extent for the highly populous country, and currently under progress. India has already been hit by a massive second wave of infection in April-June, 2021 mainly due to the delta variant, and might see a third wave in the near future that needs to be controlled with effective control strategies. In this paper, we present a compartmental epidemiological model with vaccinations incorporating the dose-dependent effectiveness. We study a possible sudden outbreak of SARS-CoV2 variants in the future, and bring out the associated predictions for various vaccination rates and point out optimum control measures. Our results show that for transmission rate 30% higher than the current rate due to emergence of new variant or relaxation of social distancing conditions, daily new cases can peak to 250k in March 2022, taking the second dose effectiveness dropping to 50% in the future. Combination of vaccination and controlled lockdown or social distancing is the key to tackling the current situation and for the coming few months. Our simulation results show that social distancing measures show better control over the disease spread than the higher vaccination rates.\",\"published\":\"NA\",\"server\":\"medrxiv\"}]}\r\n",

Local population dynamics is important for determining the strength of this rescue effect, but the mechanistic link between local demographic parameters and the rescue effect at the metapopulation level has received very little attention by modellers. We develop an analytical framework that allows us to describe the emergence of the rescue effect from interacting local stochastic dynamics. We show this framework to be applicable to a wide range of spatial scales, providing a powerful and convenient alternative to individual-based models for making predictions concerning the fate of metapopulations. We show that the rescue effect plays an important role in minimising the increase in local extinction probability associated with high demographic stochasticity, but its role is more limited in the case of high local environmental stochasticity of recruitment or survival. While most models postulate the rescue effect, our framework provides an explicit mechanistic link between local dynamics and the emergence of the rescue effect, and more generally the stability of the whole metapopulation.', 'published': '10.1098/rspb.2013.3127', 'server': 'biorxiv'}\n"
